# shift word x spaces
 
This code snippet defines a function called shift_x_spaces_right that takes in two parameters: word and shift_by.

The function shifts each character in the word to the right by the specified number of spaces (shift_by). If shift_by is negative, it wraps around to the beginning of the word.

The shifted word is then printed to the console.
